## SQL

```{r setupdb, include=FALSE}
# make sure you write the path to your sqlite path here
db <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "C:/Users/Joon/CMSC320/HW2/lahman2016.sqlite") 
```



1) How many franchises are listed in the database (see [`count`](https://sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html#count))?

```{sql q1, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
Select count (*) from TeamsFranchises
```

2) How many franchises are currently active?

```{sql q2, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
select count(*) from TeamsFranchises where active = 'Y'
```

3) Which teams won more than 100 games in one season between 2000 and 2015? Order result by descending number of wins. (attribute `W` of the Teams table contains the number of wins)

```{sql q3, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
select * from Teams where yearID <= 2015 and yearID >= 2000 and W >100 order by W DESC
```


4) What is the franchise name of the team with the most total wins in the database?

```{sql q4, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
with t1(franchName,teamID,franchID,W) as (select franchName,teamID,franchID,sum(W) 
  from Teams natural join TeamsFranchises group by franchID,franchName) 
    select franchName, W from t1 where W = (select max(W) from t1)
```

5) What is the franchise name of the team with the highest winning percentage in a season in the database? (Win percentage is `W/G`)

```{sql q5, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
with t1(franchName,teamID,franchID,winP) as (select franchName,teamID,franchID,(1.0 * W/G)
  from Teams natural join TeamsFranchises group by franchID,teamID,franchName) 
    select franchName from t1 where winP = (select max(winP) from t1)
```

6) What is the franchise name of the team with the highest single-year payroll between 2000 and 2015?

```{sql q6, connection=db, eval=TRUE}
with t1(yearID,teamID,sum) as (select yearID,teamID,Sum(salary) 
  from salaries where yearID <= 2015 and yearID >=2000 group by yearID,teamID)
    select franchName from TeamsFranchises where franchID = 
      (select franchID from teams where teamID = 
        (select teamID from t1 where sum = (select max(sum) from t1)))

```

7) (BONUS from [MDSR book](https://mdsr-book.github.io/)): Identify players (by first and last name) that have attained through their career either a) 500 or more HRs or b) 3000 or more hits (H) _and_ have not been inducted to the Hall of Fame (see `HallOfFame` table).

```{sql q7, connection=db, eval=FALSE}
```

```{r disconnectdb, include=FALSE}
DBI::dbDisconnect(db)
```
